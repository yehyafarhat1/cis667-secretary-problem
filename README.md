## Proper attribution and link to any existing code you used in your project


## Dependencies requirements and installation in these codes
This project requires Python 3.8. It's strongly recommended to use Conda or Anaconda to set up a new Python virtual environment for theses codes. 

The requirements.txt file contains all the dependencies which were exported by pip freeze. 

To set up an Conda or Anaconda environment, please refer to theses:

https://medium.com/@p.rajeshbabu6666/how-to-create-new-environments-in-anaconda-a7ff0b47ced4


When a conda/Anaconda virtual environment is active, use
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install all the dependencies automatically. 
Make sure to execute the command in the same directory with requirements.txt. 

## How to run these codes as an interactive domain program
To run these codes, please make sure that the pre-set environment with dependencies in requirements.txt is active. 

On this virtual environment, go to the project's root directory and run:
```
python main.py
```
The program will start with prompts. Following the prompts step by step, the experiments will run. 


## How to run these codes as a computer experiment
Please follow the previous step and select the appropriate options.
